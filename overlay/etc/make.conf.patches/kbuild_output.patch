Adapt for usage of the KBUILD_OUTPUT feature.

This feature allows to separate the kernel source from the
kernel build output object files, and the make.conf variable
KBUILD_OUTPUT will be set to the directory containing the kernel
object files (as well as the kernel configuration files) for the
kernel to be used as a target for ebuilds to be emerged.

Note that this can be a different kernel than is currently
running, and it can also be different from the kernel the
/usr/src/linux symlink points to.
