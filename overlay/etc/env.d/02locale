# First of all: Let's assume we want to use the Latin-9 (a.k.a. ISO-8859-15) character set system-wide.
# Latin-9 is mostly identical to Latin-1, but also includes the 'Euro' currency symbol.

# $LANG provides a default value which is used by all $LC_* variables that have
# not been defined.
# Note that specific $LC_* options override the default from $LANG,
# and that $LC_ALL overrides $LANG as well as any individual $LC_* settings.
# POSIX says $LANG cannot contain @-modifier.
# But I just cannot believe this also holds for Linux,
# because without that modifier even de_AT.ISO-8859-15 will use "EUR" instead of the Euro-symbol.
LANG="de_AT.utf8"

# Used by catgets/gettext & friends only; overrides LANG and locale settings.
LANGUAGE="de_AT.utf8:de_DE.utf8:en_US.utf8"

# Search path template for translation catalogs.
# %L is the effective value of LC_MESSAGES as reported by 'locale'.
# %N is name of catalog file.
NLSPATH="/usr/share/locale/%L/%N:/usr/share/locale/%L/LC_MESSAGES/%N"

# And again for GNOME Desktop Manager.
