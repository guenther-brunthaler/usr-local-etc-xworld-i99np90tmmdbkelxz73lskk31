# A server for the RFC 868 time service.
#
# The rdate client application (such as the one in BusyBox) can use this
# service to set the local time in a much simpler (though less exact) way than
# using NTP.
#
# The service returns a 4-octet unsigned integer in network byte order,
# representing the number of seconds elapsed since 1900-01-01 00:00:00 GMT.
